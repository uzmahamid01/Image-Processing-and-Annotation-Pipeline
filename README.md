# Image Processing and Annotation Pipeline (Python)

This repository contains Python code for processing and annotating images, particularly valuable for tasks like training machine learning models. I

### What it does:

- Preprocesses images: Loads images, resizes if needed, and applies necessary conversions for further processing.
- Extracts semantic information: Detects and extracts boundaries of objects based on predefined labels, using OpenCV for contour detection and processing.
- Generates annotations: Creates detailed annotations in a structured format (Label Studio) containing label information and object boundary data.
- Supports diverse data structures: Provides classes for organizing and managing image data and corresponding annotations.

### Key Libraries and Dependencies:
- yaml: Used for storing and loading data in YAML format, offering readability and flexibility for configuration files.
- cv2 (OpenCV): A powerful computer vision library for image processing, manipulation, and feature extraction. It enables tasks like contour detection and boundary extraction.
- PIL (Python Imaging Library): Used for opening, manipulating, and saving images in various formats. It provides essential image loading and conversion functionalities.
- numpy: It offers efficient array manipulation and mathematical operations, crucial for image processing calculations.
- matplotlib.pyplot: Allows the visualization of images and processed data for better understanding and debugging.
- json: The built-in JSON module facilitates working with data in JSON format, a common choice for data interchange and storage.
- uuid: Provides functions for generating unique identifiers, potentially used for labeling and tracking annotations within the dataset.

### Key Features:
Machine learning focus: Generates annotations compatible with Label Studio format, often used for training machine learning models.
